# Getting Started

## Installation

Aidoku can be installed using TestFlight or through a service like AltStore that allows you to install ipa files.

### TestFlight Installation

1. Join the Aidoku [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/9U8cC5Zk3s) server
2. In the **#install-info** channel, click the button at the bottom labeled "**Join Beta**"
3. Provide your email in the popup
4. Check your email for an email inviting you to the beta, and press "**View in Testflight**"
5. Download TestFlight from the App Store
6. Install Aidoku from TestFlight after accepting the invitation

### AltStore / SideStore source

We have an AltStore source that contains the latest released build, which can be accessed by adding the following source link to AltStore or SideStore: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aidoku/Aidoku/altstore/apps.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aidoku/Aidoku/altstore/apps.json). Please note that AltStore PAL is not supported.

### Manual Installation

Compiled ipa files can be optained from the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/Aidoku/Aidoku/releases) page. If you're jailbroken or have another method of sideloading, this may be the simplest option, but also requires you to sideload a new ipa after every app update.

### Troubleshooting

## Installing a source

Once Aidoku has been installed, you will need to use a source in order to add content to your library.

Some built-in sources are available by default by pressing the add button in the **Browse** tab. External sources are distributed in .aix packages that can be installed by importing them inside Aidoku. Alternatively, source lists can be added in the settings page which allow installation directly from the Browse tab.

Note that all external sources are unofficial and not affiliated with Aidoku. Use them at your own risk.

## Adding content to your library

Once have a source installed, you can find and add content to your library.

Start by opening your desired source in the **Browse** tab. There will be a search icon or search bar at the top allowing you to search for content the source provides.

When you find your desired content, open it and tap on the bookmark icon. Alternatively, you can long press on the item and select **Add to Library**. Once added to your library, the item should appear in the **Library** tab.
