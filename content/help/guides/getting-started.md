2. In the **#rules** channel, click the button labeled "**Send me Instructions**"
3. Respond to the DM from the Aidoku bot by using the **/invite** command and providing your email
4. Check your email for an email inviting you to the beta, and press "**View in Testflight**"
5. Download TestFlight from the App Store
