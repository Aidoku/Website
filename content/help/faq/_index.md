{% end %}

### iCloud Sync
#### Why isn't my library always being synced across devices?
iCloud Sync is still somewhat buggy at the moment and it's hit or miss if the syncing actually works. Consider toggling it off and on again.

### Library
#### How can I see how many chapters I have unread?
Enable badges by navigating to Settings and check the **Unread Chapter Badges** section under the Library section.

### Browse
#### Why can't I see some sources?
- By default, only multi-language sources and sources in your [Preferred Languages list](https://osxdaily.com/2021/07/01/set-preferred-language-change-region-iphone-ipad/#:~:text=Head%20over%20to%20%E2%80%9CSettings%E2%80%9D%20from,default%20language%20for%20your%20iPhone.) are shown. Enable more languages by navigating to Browse and opening the add source page, selecting the globe icon on the top right, and then selecting the languages you want.
- NSFW sources are hidden by default. Navigate to Settings and enable **Show NSFW Sources** under the Browse section.

### Reader
#### Why aren't my chapters being marked as read?
- You might not have reached the last page.
- You may have **Incognito Mode** enabled. Navigate to Settings and disable **Incognito Mode** under the General section.

### User Interface
#### Can I change the app language?
Open the Settings app → Aidoku → Languages and select your language. The app will restart automatically to apply changes.

If your language isn't in the list, or the translations aren't good enough, consider helping translate the app on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/aidoku/).

## Sources
### General
#### What are some recommended sources? Which source is the best? Where do I read manga X?
Aidoku does not endorse or recommend any external sources, and users are encouraged to spend some time trying out a few sources themselves and find out what works best for them.

{% block(type="info") %}
Aidoku does not host any content, nor is Aidoku responsible for any sources that are slow, down, missing chapters, or have subpar image quality.
{% end %}
